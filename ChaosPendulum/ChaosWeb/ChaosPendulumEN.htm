<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">An ordinary
single
pendulum shows a very regular behaviour, we use it in many
mechanical
clocks for pretty good timekeeping.<o:p></o:p><br>
<o:p></o:p>If you mount a second
pendulum on the weight of a first you will have a chaos system.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
The behaviour of such a
system is extremely dependent on the starting condition and -as any
moment can
be regarded as the starting condition for what follows- the system will
continue to be chaotic.<br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The
chaotic behaviour
comes from the energy exchange between the main- and the second
pendulum, not
from any kind of random noise or the like.<br>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This
pendulum is
electrically driven to compensate for the friction losses, but in such
a way
that chaos is not promoted. The main pendulum gets a push in the right
direction every time it passes the lowest point of its orbit. The
second
pendulum has no drive of its own.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This pendulum is
built
from some parts from a dismantled harddisk, the
case, the disk-motor and
the bearing of the head lever.</span> And it took some machining of pieces aluminium I happened to have in stock.<span style="font-family: Arial;"> <br>
The electrical drive is controlled by an
Arduino
Nano.</span><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">The electrical schema. None of the components is
critical. Select the power FET's for gate-on threshold &lt; 3Volts.
Resistors should be chosen for suitable LED brightness. The power
supply should be able to deliver 2 A minimal.</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The drive control works
as follows:</span><br>On
both sides of the Lower Dead Point (LDP) optical shutters A and B
are mounted to measure the direction and the velocity of the main
pendulum when it passes. After each pass the motor is activated in the
proper direction during a time which depends on the measured velocity.<br>
The motor has 3 phases and 4 poles, so the mechanical angle between two
successive phases is 30°. The angle between the shutters is 5.7°.<br>
<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><img src="Chaos-Files/MotorPhases.jpg" alt="MotorPhases.jpg"></h2>
Suppose the LDP is in line with the V-phase as in the drawing. At a
pass from left to right we must activate the W-phase, but not longer
than until the pendulum passes beyond the W-point, because then it would
be pulled back again.<br>
Measuring the velocity is done by sampling the optical shutters at a 4
kHz rate. During a pass we find a number of N counts for the 5.7° pass.<br>
We activate the W-phase at 5.7 / 2 = 2.35°. Suppose that the pendulum
continues at the same speed (which is not true) we should deactivate
the W phase at 30°. That is N * (30 - 2.35) / 5.7 = N * 4.85 counts
later. The expectation/purpose is that the pendulum accellerates during
that time, so we have to switch off somewhat earlier, a factor of 4
appeared to work well. The advantage of a whole numer is also that we
do not need floating point calculations.<br>
It appeared that this way not enough energy was pumped into the system.
So a second push was realized by switching on the U-phase after
deactivating the W-phase. This lasts somewhat shorter, a factor of 3 *
N counts works well.<br>
When the pass is in the other direction everything goes the other way
around.<br>
<br>
Now we must take care that the pendulum does not accumulate to much
energy. The indication for that is when the main pendulum makes several
complete loopings in succesion in the same direction. We detect this by counting the
number of passes AB and BA, and if we have seen more than X the same
pass the activation of the motor is suspended. If we then see a pass
in the other direction that counter is zeroed again, which releases the suspend. <br>
X = 4 appears to
work well.<br>
<br>
We must also organize that the system starts moving, independent from where
the pendulum sits still (*).The firmware can differentiate between 3
locations, on the A shutter, on the B shutter or elsewhere. For all
these situations there is a test, if that position is kept to long
(over 8 seconds), one of the motor phases is activated for a while. Now
it could be that the pendulum sits in line with that phase, so nothing
will happen. That situation is anticipated by activating another phase
at the next try.<br>
<br>
During the devleopment serial communication has been used for
diagnostics. When everything worked well this has been changed into
output which can be directly used for logging in a comma separated file
which can be processed further.<br>
<br>
(*) Also during the normal chaotic movements the pendulum could come to
a standstill in the upper dead point. In spite of this being an
instable balance the system might stall there because of small fricton
in the bearings. <br>
